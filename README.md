## Hi there 👋

Welcome! 👋 I’m a security engineer with a deep interest in building safer systems and understanding how to identify and mitigate potential risks before they become real threats. This repository reflects my current learning journey into threat modeling and vulnerability scanning, two foundational practices in modern cybersecurity.

I’m focused on learning how to approach security from both a proactive and reactive standpoint—mapping out potential attack surfaces, understanding system architecture from an adversary’s perspective, and using automated tools to uncover weaknesses early in the development lifecycle.

In the area of threat modeling, I’m exploring methodologies like STRIDE, attack trees, and data flow diagrams to anticipate and design against potential threats. I’m also building templates and lightweight frameworks to make threat modeling more accessible and integrated into agile development workflows.

On the vulnerability scanning side, I’m working with tools like OWASP ZAP, Nmap, and open-source scanners to automate the discovery of misconfigurations, insecure dependencies, and exploitable flaws. My goal is to create repeatable processes that can help teams shift security left—identifying and fixing issues during development, rather than after deployment.

This repository includes example configurations, scripts, resources, and small tools I’ve developed or customized to support learning and real-world practice. I aim to document everything clearly so that others on a similar path can follow along, reuse what works, and improve what doesn’t.

If you’re interested in application security, DevSecOps, or just building better defenses, feel free to explore, share feedback, or collaborate.

Thanks for checking out the repo—security is a journey, and I’m excited to keep learning and building better practices, one step at a time. 🛡️🔍💻
